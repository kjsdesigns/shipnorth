## Development Standards & Patterns

### Architecture Patterns

**1. Centralized Environment Configuration**
- **Single Source of Truth:** All environment variables in `.env` file
- **Port Configuration:** WEB_PORT=8849, API_PORT=8850, POSTGRES_PORT=5432
- **URL Generation:** Dynamic URLs generated from centralized ports
- **Anti-Pattern Prevention:** Hardcoded ports/URLs forbidden in code

**2. Perfection-Only Development Standards**
- **No Partial Success:** 100% completion required before task declaration
- **Comprehensive Testing:** All changes must pass full test suite
- **Error Resolution:** Fix ALL errors, not just some errors
- **Quality Gates:** Health checks include React runtime error detection

**3. Multi-Stage Docker Architecture**
- **Optimized Builds:** First build ~2.5min, subsequent ~30sec
- **Layer Caching:** Dependencies cached until package.json changes
- **Playwright Integration:** Browser downloads cached in Docker layers
- **Resource Management:** Dedicated CPU/memory limits for services

### Code Quality Standards

**TypeScript Best Practices:**
- Strict type definitions with complete interfaces
- Proper error type handling in catch blocks
- Consistent data structure evolution with migrations
- Complete type imports (both class and type)
- Array initialization with explicit types

**React/Next.js Patterns:**
- Function components with TypeScript interfaces
- Custom hooks for state management
- Context providers for global state
- Error boundaries for graceful degradation
- Infinite render loop prevention

**API Design Standards:**
- RESTful endpoint structure
- Consistent error response format
- JWT authentication middleware
- Role-based authorization
- Rate limiting (200 req/min production, 1000 req/min dev)

## Key Functionality & Features

### Authentication System

**Multi-Role Architecture:**
```typescript
interface User {
  role: 'customer' | 'staff' | 'admin' | 'driver'; // Legacy compatibility
  roles?: ('staff' | 'admin' | 'driver' | 'customer')[]; // Multi-role support
  lastUsedPortal?: 'staff' | 'driver' | 'customer';
  availablePortals: string[];
  defaultPortal: string;
}
```

- JWT-based authentication (24hr + 30-day refresh)
- Multi-role support (e.g., driver+staff combinations)
- Portal switching with preference persistence
- Session management with automatic renewal
