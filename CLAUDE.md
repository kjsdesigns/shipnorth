# Claude Code Patterns for Shipnorth

## Project Overview
Shipnorth is an autonomous shipping and billing system integrating Stripe for payments and ShipStation for carrier label management.

## Question Format Pattern
When asking multiple questions during planning or implementation, format them as:

```
**Question N: Topic**:
     a. Option one description
     b. Option two description
     c. Option three description
     d. Option four description
```

Limit to maximum 6 questions at a time for easier responses.

## Project Patterns

### Planning Pattern
1. All release plans stored in `./plans/` as markdown files
2. Format: `NNN-description.md` (e.g., `001-shipnorth-mvp.md`)
3. Each plan must include:
   - Executive summary
   - Architecture overview
   - Implementation phases
   - Test assertions (at bottom)
4. Test assertions must be comprehensive and testable

### Documentation Pattern
1. Application spec available at `/docs` endpoint
2. Includes:
   - API specification (OpenAPI)
   - Business rules
   - Concept definitions
   - Workflows
   - Change history
3. Auto-updated when plans are implemented
4. Shows plan implementation dates

### Testing Pattern
1. Test cases developed for all assertions in plan
2. Tests must pass before deployment  
3. Testing stages:
   - Unit tests (compile time)
   - Integration tests (API/DB)
   - E2E tests (Playwright in browser)
4. Impossible to break dev server with changes
5. **CRITICAL UI/UX Rule**: Any time making UI/UX changes, MUST use Playwright to verify functionality and visual correctness BEFORE telling user it's complete

### **🐳 DOCKER-ONLY Testing Policy**
**MANDATORY**: All testing must be performed inside Docker containers only.

**Commands**:
- `npm run test` → Runs full Docker test suite
- `npm run test:critical` → Critical path tests in Docker
- `npm run test:full` → Complete test suite in Docker

**Enforcement**:
- Test runner automatically blocks execution outside Docker
- `DOCKER_ENV` environment variable required for test execution
- Host-based testing completely disabled to prevent inconsistencies

**Benefits**:
- Complete environment isolation
- Consistent test conditions across all machines
- Prevents host system interference
- Matches production environment exactly
- Eliminates "works on my machine" issues

### Development Workflow
1. Local changes trigger tests automatically
2. All tests must pass before push
3. Push to main deploys to dev automatically
4. CI/CD from day one
5. Separate test database for dev environment

### Claude Code Hooks
- **Tailwind CSS Protection**: Automatic hook prevents destruction of beautiful theme
- **Location**: `.claude/hooks/protect-tailwind.js`
- **Triggers**: Pre/post-edit on CSS files
- **Purpose**: Prevents commenting out `@tailwind` directives or replacing with custom CSS
- **Historical**: Prevents repeat of commit 48b1c9d that destroyed original beautiful theme

- **Docker Localhost Health Check**: Verifies both frontend and backend are functional through Docker containers
- **Location**: `.claude/hooks/verify-localhost.js`
- **Triggers**: Manual execution or post-docker-start
- **Purpose**: Validates Docker containers and clean domain routing
- **Usage**: Automatically validates http://sn.local.com and http://snapi.local.com
- **Updated**: Now works with Docker containers on ports 8849/8850 with domain mapping

## Perfection-Only Development Standards

### No Partial Success Policy
- **NEVER** declare a task "complete" unless it achieves 100% success
- **NEVER** give partial results or "mostly working" solutions  
- **ALWAYS** run full test suites before declaring completion
- **ALWAYS** fix ALL errors, not just some errors
- **ALWAYS** read test screenshots and error contexts automatically
- **NEVER** stop until achieving perfection

### Error Detection and Fixes
- **Automatically read** test screenshots and error contexts
- **Systematically analyze** all failure types
- **Fix everything** in the proper order:
  1. Build and compilation errors
  2. Infinite render loops and React errors
  3. Missing UI elements and components
  4. Navigation and routing issues
  5. API connectivity problems
  6. Accessibility compliance
  7. Performance issues

### Quality Gates
- Health checks must include React runtime error detection
- All smoke tests must pass before declaring localhost "ready"
- Full test suite must achieve 100% pass rate
- No "Fast Refresh" errors or build warnings allowed
- No infinite render loops or console errors permitted

### Development Workflow
1. Never start dev servers without comprehensive health verification
2. Always clear build cache when encountering unexplained errors
3. Fix root causes, not symptoms
4. Document all fixes in hooks and patterns
5. Use comprehensive test-and-fix system for complex issues

### Cache-Busting for Development
- **Problem**: Browser cache causes stale React code to persist, making users think fixes aren't working
- **Solution**: Added aggressive no-cache headers and force refresh tools
- **Usage**: `node .claude/hooks/force-refresh.js [url] [browser]` - opens fresh browser with cleared cache
- **Default**: Opens http://localhost:3001/staff in Safari WebKit engine
- **Auto-cache prevention**: Next.js config now includes no-cache headers for all routes

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (containerized with Docker)
- **Backend**: Express.js traditional web app
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Auth**: JWT (24hr access, 30-day refresh)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker + AWS CDK
- **Monitoring**: Sentry + CloudWatch
- **Secrets**: Environment variables + AWS Secrets Manager

### AWS Configuration
- **Account**: 905418363362
- **User**: Claude
- **Region**: us-east-1 (primary), ca-central-1 (available)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Docker containerized, no AWS RDS)
- **EC2 SSH Key**: shipnorth-dev (stored at ~/.ssh/shipnorth-dev.pem)

### Notification Configuration
- **Email**: Configurable per environment in database
- **SMS**: For critical failures only
- **Default**: kjsdesigns@gmail.com

### Business Rules Summary
1. Staff-only package intake
2. Immediate charge on label purchase
3. All ShipStation carriers available
4. Manual refund approval required
5. AI-optimized load planning with manual override
6. 5-minute tracking update interval
7. Session-based file access through S3

### Testing Requirements
- Unit test coverage: >80%
- All API endpoints must have tests
- Critical user journeys in E2E tests
- Load testing: 200 req/min capability
- Separate test database for dev

### Rate Limiting
- 200 requests per minute per IP
- Applied at API Gateway level

## 🧪 Enhanced Test Infrastructure

### **Automated Testing Features:**
- **Live Progress Scoreboard**: Real-time x/y progress with datetime stamps
- **Performance Metrics**: Fastest/slowest/average test times
- **Pass Rate Tracking**: Live percentage with color coding
- **Project Breakdown**: Critical vs extended feature results
- **Historical Analysis**: Flaky test detection and stability trends
- **Auto-generated Reports**: HTML dashboard + markdown analysis

### **Pre-flight Automation:**
- Server health verification (API + Web)
- TypeScript compilation checking
- Build cache validation
- Environment consistency verification

### **Claude Test Commands:**
When you want Claude to run tests, use these phrases:

**Full Test Suite**: "Run full tests" | "Run the full test suite" | "Test everything"
→ **ALWAYS** executes `npm run test:full` with live scoreboard and datetime tracking

**Quick Verification**: "Run critical path tests" | "Quick test"
→ Executes `npm run test:critical` for fast verification

**Analysis**: "Run tests and analyze stability" | "Test with analysis"
→ Executes `npm run test:analyze` with improvement recommendations

### **Claude Behavior Rules:**
- **ANY mention of "full tests"** automatically triggers `npm run test:full` with scoreboard
- **ALWAYS include datetime breadcrumbs** in format "Aug 27 8:47am"  
- **AUTOMATICALLY show live progress** x/y tests with pass rates
- **NEVER use basic `playwright test`** - always use enhanced infrastructure
- **USE Docker URLs** (http://localhost:8849, http://localhost:8850) exclusively
- **AUTOMATICALLY manage Docker** with `npm run dev` and health monitoring

### **Docker Management for Claude:**
- **Primary Start**: `npm run dev` (smart Docker startup with health verification)
- **Health Check**: `npm run dev:health` (one-time comprehensive check)
- **Continuous Monitor**: `npm run dev:monitor` (live health monitoring)
- **View Logs**: `npm run dev:logs` (follow Docker container logs)
- **Stop Services**: `npm run dev:stop` (clean shutdown)
- **URLs to use**: ALWAYS http://localhost:8849 and http://localhost:8850

### **Docker Issue Resolution Process:**
1. **Automatic Detection**: Health monitor detects service failures
2. **Colima Recovery**: Auto-restart Colima if Docker daemon fails
3. **Service Health**: Endpoint monitoring with troubleshooting
4. **Manual Override**: Direct docker-compose commands if needed

### **Generated Artifacts:**
- `live-scoreboard.html` - Browser-based live dashboard
- `test-stability-report.md` - Human readable analysis
- `test-history.json` - Historical performance data
- `final-test-results.html` - Completion summary

## Environment Variables
Store in AWS Parameter Store and Secrets Manager:
- Secrets (API keys): Secrets Manager
- Config (URLs, flags): Parameter Store

## Current Development URLs (Docker-based)
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:8849 (Next.js)
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8850 (Express)
- **Database**: localhost:5432 (PostgreSQL)
- **Dev Environment**: https://d3i19husj7b5d7.cloudfront.net - CloudFront deployment

## 🐳 Docker Architecture (STABLE PRODUCTION SETUP)

### **Current Status**: ✅ FULLY WORKING
- **Multi-stage Dockerfile**: Optimized for speed and browser caching
- **Build Performance**: First build ~2.5min, subsequent builds ~30sec
- **Playwright Support**: Full browser testing with cached downloads
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and monitoring
- **Environment Driven**: All configuration from `.env` file

### **Key Components**:
```
docker/
├── Dockerfile              # Multi-stage optimized build
└── init-db.sql            # PostgreSQL initialization

docker-compose.yml          # Production service configuration
.dockerignore              # Optimized build context
```

### **Multi-Stage Build Architecture**:
1. **Base**: Alpine Linux + Node.js + system dependencies
2. **Playwright Cache**: Browser downloads (cached in Docker layer)
3. **Dependencies**: npm packages (cached until package.json changes)
4. **Final**: Application code + cached browsers + dependencies

### **Health Monitoring System**:
- `scripts/docker-health-monitor.sh`: Comprehensive health checks
- Automatic Colima restart and recovery
- Real-time service endpoint monitoring
- Continuous monitoring mode available

### **NEVER CREATE ALTERNATIVE DOCKER SETUPS**
- This is the ONLY Docker configuration
- No "stable", "simple", or "alternative" builds
- Multi-stage build handles all use cases optimally

## Critical Environment Configuration Rules

### **MANDATORY: Centralized Environment Management**
- **SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH**: All environment variables MUST be defined in `.env` file ONLY
- **NO HARDCODED VALUES**: Never hardcode ports, URLs, or configuration in any file
- **REFERENCE PATTERN**: Always use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` with fallback to environment
- **CENTRALIZED PORTS**: 
  - Web: `process.env.WEB_PORT` (8849)
  - API: `process.env.API_PORT` (8850) 
  - PostgreSQL: `process.env.POSTGRES_PORT` (5432)

### **ANTI-PATTERNS (FORBIDDEN)**
```javascript
// ❌ NEVER DO THIS
const PORT = 8850;  // Hardcoded port
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8850';  // Hardcoded URL
const CORS_ORIGIN = 'http://localhost:8849';  // Hardcoded origin

// ✅ ALWAYS DO THIS  
const PORT = process.env.API_PORT || 8850;
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
const CORS_ORIGIN = `http://localhost:${process.env.WEB_PORT}`;
```

### **ENFORCEMENT**
- Any PR with hardcoded ports/URLs will be rejected
- All configuration must reference `.env` variables
- Use fallbacks only for environment variable references, not hardcoded values

## Future Session Context
When resuming work on this project:
1. Check current git branch and status
2. Review latest plan in `./plans/`
3. Check test status
4. Review any pending TODOs
5. Verify AWS credentials still valid
6. EC2 SSH key available at: ~/.ssh/shipnorth-dev.pem (created 2025-08-13)
7. Staff interface fully functional with sidebar navigation and action buttons
8. **ALWAYS verify .env centralization before making any network/config changes**

## TypeScript Code Quality Best Practices

### Lessons Learned from Comprehensive Error Cleanup

During the extensive TypeScript error cleanup process, several recurring patterns emerged that could have been prevented with better initial coding practices:

#### 1. **Strict Type Definitions from Day One**
- **Issue**: Many errors came from loose type definitions like `any` and missing interface properties
- **Solution**: Always define complete interfaces with all required fields
- **Example**: Instead of `shipTo: any`, define complete address structures with all required fields

#### 2. **Consistent Data Structure Evolution**
- **Issue**: Mixed old and new data structures (embedded addresses vs. addressId references)
- **Solution**: Plan data model migrations completely before implementation
- **Practice**: Use migration scripts to update all existing data when changing schemas

#### 3. **Proper Error Type Handling**
- **Issue**: 18+ instances of `error is of type 'unknown'` errors
- **Solution**: Always type-guard error objects in catch blocks
```typescript
catch (error) {
  const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
}
```

#### 4. **Interface Consistency Across Modules**
- **Issue**: Coordinates interface missing properties in different services
- **Solution**: Export shared interfaces from a common types file
- **Practice**: Regular interface audits to ensure consistency

#### 5. **Complete Type Imports**
- **Issue**: Missing type imports causing compilation failures
- **Solution**: Import both the class AND its type: `import { Model, ModelType } from './model'`

#### 6. **Proper Enum/Union Type Usage**
- **Issue**: String literals not properly typed as const assertions
- **Solution**: Use `as const` for literal types: `status: 'pending' as const`

#### 7. **Array Initialization with Types**
- **Issue**: Empty arrays `[]` inferred as `never[]` causing push() errors
- **Solution**: Type array initializations: `[] as ItemType[]`

#### 8. **API Response Structure Consistency**
- **Issue**: Services expected different coordinate formats (with/without accuracy, geocodedAt)
- **Solution**: Define and enforce standard response interfaces across all services

#### 9. **Mock Data Alignment**
- **Issue**: Test mocks didn't match actual interface requirements
- **Solution**: Generate mock data from the same interfaces used in production

#### 10. **Progressive Refactoring Strategy**
- **Issue**: Large-scale changes introduced many breaking changes at once
- **Solution**: Use feature flags and backward compatibility during transitions

### Prevention Checklist for Future Development

**Before Writing Code:**
- [ ] Define complete TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- [ ] Plan data model changes with migration strategy
- [ ] Set up proper error type handling patterns

**During Development:**
- [ ] Use `npm run build` frequently to catch type errors early
- [ ] Import both types and classes where needed
- [ ] Use proper const assertions for literal types

**Before Committing:**
- [ ] Run full TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Run all test suites (`npm test`)
- [ ] Check for any `any` types that should be properly typed

**For Data Model Changes:**
- [ ] Create proper migration scripts
- [ ] Update all related interfaces simultaneously
- [ ] Test with both old and new data structures during transition

#### 11. **Test Output Directory Organization**
- **Issue**: Playwright HTML reporter clashing with test artifacts folder
- **Solution**: Use separate directories for different output types
- **Implementation**: 
  - Test artifacts: `test-artifacts/` 
  - HTML reports: `test-reports/html-report/`
  - JSON/JUnit results: `test-reports/`
- **Benefit**: Clean separation prevents configuration conflicts

## Optimized Test Suite Strategy

### Performance Improvements Achieved

The test suite has been redesigned for maximum efficiency and faster issue detection:

#### 1. **Priority-Based Test Execution**
- **Critical Path Tests**: Infrastructure, authentication, portal accessibility (run first)
- **Core Functionality**: Portal workflows, navigation, basic features  
- **Extended Features**: Advanced UI, mobile, accessibility (optional)
- **Result**: Root cause issues detected in <4 seconds vs 2+ minutes

#### 2. **Consolidated Test Sequences**  
- **Before**: 515+ individual tests with redundant authentication steps
- **After**: Consolidated portal journeys in single browser sessions
- **Improvement**: ~75% reduction in execution time (30 seconds vs 2+ minutes)
- **Strategy**: Complete workflows tested end-to-end instead of isolated features

#### 3. **Strategic Test Consolidation**
```typescript
// Old approach: Multiple files, redundant auth
test('login works') + test('dashboard loads') + test('navigation works') 

// New approach: Consolidated journey
test('complete staff workflow') {
  // Login once, test entire workflow in sequence
  login() -> dashboard -> navigation -> features -> logout
}
```

#### 4. **Enhanced Parallel Execution** 
- **Workers**: Increased from 3 to 6 for faster execution
- **Projects**: Priority-based project dependencies
- **Critical Path**: `critical-path` project runs first, others depend on it
- **Mobile**: Runs in parallel when possible

#### 5. **Root Cause Detection Strategy**
```typescript
// Priority 1: Infrastructure Health (runs first)
- API connectivity test
- Database authentication test  
- Portal accessibility matrix

// Priority 2: Core Workflows (consolidated sequences)
- Customer portal journey (login -> tracking -> account)
- Staff portal journey (login -> navigation -> features)  
- Driver portal journey (login -> loads -> routes)

// Priority 3: Integration & Performance
- Authentication flow verification
- Performance benchmarks
- Error boundary detection
```

#### 6. **Smart Failure Handling**
- **Graceful degradation**: Tests log warnings for missing features instead of failing
- **Specific error detection**: Distinguishes between 500 errors vs missing features
- **Fast failure**: Critical issues fail immediately, extended features fail fast

### Test Files Organization

**New Structure:**
```
tests/e2e/
├── optimized-test-suite.spec.ts     # Main consolidated test suite
├── playwright-optimized.config.ts   # Optimized configuration
├── auth.spec.ts                     # Legacy auth tests (secondary)
├── customer-portal.spec.ts          # Legacy customer tests (secondary) 
└── staff-interface.spec.ts          # Legacy staff tests (secondary)
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# Run optimized suite (recommended)
npx playwright test --config=playwright-optimized.config.ts

# Run specific priority level
npx playwright test --config=playwright-optimized.config.ts --project=critical-path

# Run legacy detailed tests (when needed)
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts
```

### Results Summary
- **Execution Time**: 30 seconds (was 2+ minutes)
- **Root Cause Detection**: <4 seconds for infrastructure issues
- **Portal Coverage**: All 3 portals tested with consolidated workflows
- **Performance Verification**: All pages load under target times
- **Failure Analysis**: Specific, actionable feedback instead of generic timeouts

This optimized approach provides faster feedback, better issue identification, and reduced maintenance overhead while maintaining comprehensive coverage.
