### **✅ Database Integration** 
- **Before**: Mixed DynamoDB/PostgreSQL calls causing failures
- **After**: Unified PostgreSQL-only database layer
- **Status**: All core models working (User, Customer, Package, Load)

### **✅ Package Creation Workflow**
- **Before**: Non-functional due to database/auth issues
- **After**: Fully functional two-step customer selection → package creation
- **Status**: Complete end-to-end workflow verified working

### **✅ API Authentication**
- **Before**: Missing authenticate middleware on package routes
- **After**: Proper authentication/authorization on all protected routes

## 🗃️ **Migration Summary**

### **Fully Migrated Models (PostgreSQL Only):**
- ✅ `UserModel` - Complete with multi-role support
- ✅ `CustomerModel` - Complete with payment integration
- ✅ `PackageModel` - Complete with shipping functionality
- ✅ `LoadModel` - Complete with driver assignment
- ✅ `CityModel` - Complete with geographic data
- ✅ `AddressModel` - Complete with geocoding support
- ✅ `OptimizedRouteModel` - Complete with route optimization

### **Cleaned Up:**
- ✅ **Backup Files**: Removed entire `src-backup/` directory
- ✅ **Compiled Artifacts**: Removed all `*dynamodb*.d.ts` and `.js` files
- ✅ **Dependencies**: No DynamoDB packages in package.json
- ✅ **Configuration**: Updated .env and service exports

### **Remaining References (Non-Critical):**
- ⚠️ **Test Files**: Some unit tests still mock DynamoDB patterns (functional but could be updated)
- ⚠️ **Invoice Model**: Still uses DatabaseService calls (non-critical, invoicing not in current workflow)
- ⚠️ **Documentation**: Historical references in docs (informational only)
- ⚠️ **Node Modules**: AWS SDK still present (used for other services like S3)
