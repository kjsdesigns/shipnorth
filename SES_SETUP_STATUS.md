## 📈 Production Access

When ready for production (unlimited sending):

1. Go to [AWS SES Console](https://ca-central-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ses/home?region=ca-central-1#/account)
2. Click "Request production access"
3. Fill out the form:
   - **Use case:** Transactional emails for shipping notifications
   - **Website:** https://shipnorth.com
   - **Compliance:** Confirm you'll only send to customers who've opted in
   - **Volume:** Estimate 10,000 emails/month initially

Usually approved within 24-48 hours.

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

### Current (Sandbox/Testing):
- **Emails:** Free (up to 62,000/month from EC2)
- **SMS:** $0.00645 per message

### Production Pricing:
- **First 62,000 emails/month:** Free (from EC2)
- **Additional emails:** $0.10 per 1,000
- **SMS:** $0.00645 per message (Canada)

### Example Monthly Costs:
- 10,000 emails + 1,000 SMS = ~$6.45/month
- 100,000 emails + 10,000 SMS = ~$68.00/month

Compare to SendGrid + Twilio: Would be $200+/month!

## 🔧 Integration Points

The notification service is integrated and ready at:
- **Service:** `/apps/api/src/services/notifications.ts`
- **Templates:** Package created, delivered, payment failed
- **Auto-triggers:** On package events

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Right now:** Check your email and click verification links
2. **Today:** Test email sending works
3. **This week:** Request production access
4. **When ready:** Add real customer notifications to package flow

## 📝 Notes

- Emails won't work until you verify them (check spam folder too!)
- In sandbox, you can only email verified addresses
- SMS works immediately but has $1/month limit until you request increase
- Everything is using your existing AWS credentials - no new API keys needed!
